# demon-wizard-races
Assembly Language Intro Project <br />
This is a very basic program made with Assembly Language. <br />
Visually a Wizard shoots a fireball to start the race, similar to a starting pistol. <br /><br />
The two demons then race at a random number generated ranging from 0-2 steps. The first to reach the end of the screen wins. <br />
No input is needed from the user though any extension of input could be implemented easily(e.g. initially you could pick number 1,
for bottom demon or 2 for top demon to vote who would win. Winners would retain a point). <br />
