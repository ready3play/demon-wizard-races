# demon-wizard-races
Assembly Language Intro Project/n
This is a very basic program made with Assembly Language./n
Visually a Wizard shoots a fireball to start the race, similar to a starting pistol./n
The two demons then race at a random number generated ranging from 0-2 steps. The first to reach the end of the screen wins./n
No input is needed from the user though any extension of input could be implemented easily(e.g. initially you could pick number 1, /n
for bottom demon or 2 for top demon to vote who would win. Winners would retain a point. No end game has been determined yet)./n
